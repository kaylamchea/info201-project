# info-201-project

Our project focuses on out-of-school children and youth and the levels of education inequality across countries and regions. We will be creating various visualizations that demonstrate the disparities in education for children and youth across the world.

This is our [project proposal](https://github.com/kaylamchea/info201-project/wiki/Project-Proposal).
